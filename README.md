## The Kentucky Girl - Blog Template

This a website that I am doing for a friend. It was somewhat of a template for them to work off of.

This is a project for the Front-End Web Develpment course offered by Code Louisville and Treehouse.

The preview of this site is available [HERE](https://jtjeseo.github.io/KentuckyGirl "The Kentucky Girl").
