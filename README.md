# The Kentucky Girl - Blog Template

This a website that I am doing for a friend. It is a template that the client will be able to use in the future for their website.

Feel free to look around. There is a JS function on the update page and also has a mobile version on smaller screens.

The preview of this site is available **[HERE](https://jtjeseo.github.io/KentuckyGirl "The Kentucky Girl")**.

## Javascript Functionality

Updates.html and Archive.html preview my javascript code. The updates page will you show you the first name and email that you've entered in the form, and the archive page has a smooth accordion organization feature with example blog posts.

Thanks for spending the time to check out my project.
