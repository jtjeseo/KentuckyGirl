# The Kentucky Girl - Blog Template

This a website that I am doing for a friend. It was somewhat of a template for them to work off of.

Feel free to look around. There is a neat JS function on the update page and also has a mobile version on smaller screens.

This is a project for the Front-End Web Develpment course offered by Code Louisville and Treehouse.

The preview of this site is available **[HERE](https://jtjeseo.github.io/KentuckyGirl "The Kentucky Girl")**.

## Javascript Functionality

Updates.html and Archive.html preview my own javascript code. The updates page will you show you the first name and email that you've entered in the form and the archive page has a smooth accordian orginization feature with example blog posts.
