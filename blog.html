            Life is a whole bunch of moments, stacked end to end. And, I want to be in every one of them. Ones filled with joy, ones
            filled with tears, ones filled with family and friends around me and ones where I sit alone on my back porch
            on a quiet morning with my pup at my side. This morning, I am sitting on my back porch, eating birthday cake
            for breakfast (which I believe is okay to do today since it is my birthday). And, while sitting here, I'm reflecting
            on this past weekend spent with my precious, dear family, the best family in all the world. We gathered together
            to celebrate my Aunt Dottie and Uncle Butch's 50th anniversary. We ate wedding cake, we hugged, we laughed, and
            we played (and my cousin Ryan and I won) a very serious corn hole tournament.</p>

        <p>And, I had my first violin lesson.</p>

        <p>There is a sweet, sweet, sweet girl in my life. Her name is Sabrie. She is my cousin. She is my friend. And, she
            is now my violin teacher. Until this weekend, I had never taken a violin lesson. Goodness, I don't know that
            I've ever held a violin before, much less played one. But, Sabrie has. And, she is the best six-year-old violinist
            - and six-year-old teacher - that I know. I asked her for a lesson, and she was happy to give it. Most six-year-olds
            would probably be done with this type of endeavor in about six minutes, but she taught a full lesson, with books
            and technique and instruction and all. She taught me how to hold a violin, how to position the bow, how to play
            "pizzicato" and how to play "Mary Had A Little Lamb." She was an excellent teacher. She knows the technique,
            yes. But she was an excellent teacher because of her heart. Even when I sounded TERRIBLE, she said, "That was
            good! You can check that piece off! That was just right. Let's learn the next piece." If I'm honest with myself,
            I would probably have been so embarrassed or nervous to try anything like this in front of an adult. But, in
            front of her, I can do my best and sound terrible and still be so, so loved.</p>

        <p>Something else unique about Sabrie is that she is my birthday bud. I was born on June 26 in 1985, and she was born
            June 25 in 2010. She turned seven yesterday, and I have my birthday today. This weekend, we got to blow out candles
            together and share many sweet moments. And, I am thankful.</p>

        <p>I've felt for a long time that I wanted to have a blog. The work behind it is what I don't want. But, I've always
            wanted a place where my kids and my grandkids and the kids after they have something to look back on to see where
            they came from. And so, I suppose that requires work. Leaving a legacy always needs work. And, I want to leave
            a legacy. I wish for those I know to know that they are loved and that I cared about them. And I hope for them
            to have stories and recipes and life lessons to look on from my life that can benefit them for centuries to come.
            So, I hope you'll enjoy these posts.</p>

        <p>And, I hope we will all be quiet enough in our hearts to learn from the ones we might not think have anything to
            teach us. Kids can teach us how to play the violin. And they can also teach us how to love. Adults aren't the
            only ones who can leave a legacy in your heart.</p>
